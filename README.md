# Biomethane Optimization System

A comprehensive system for monitoring and controlling biomethane production, designed to improve financial feasibility, reduce anaerobic digestion retention time, and support rural development through sustainable waste management. The system uses practical engineering intelligence instead of complex AI to keep costs low while maintaining high performance.

---

## 🌱 Overview

The Biomethane Optimization System is a hybrid hardware–software platform that:

- Optimizes biogas/biomethane production cycles  
- Reduces retention time significantly compared to natural digestion  
- Provides real-time monitoring through a Flutter-based SCADA frontend  
- Uses microcontrollers (ESP8266 + MSP430) for sensor/control logic  
- Ensures financial feasibility with strict energy usage constraints  
- Supports continuous daily production using a 6-day, 5-backup-plant model

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Financial Optimization
- Ensures cost savings without burdening customers.  
- Daily optimization energy usage cannot exceed **10%** of the previous day's net energy output.

### 2. Retention Time Reduction
- Multi-stage anaerobic digestion cycle optimized to reduce retention time from **months to days**.

### 3. Environmental Compatibility
- Black thermal coating for heat absorption  
- Solar-powered heater and agitator  
- Air-jacket pressure-assisted thermal management  

### 4. Simplified Monitoring
- No MAS sensors required  
- Uses time-based, pre-optimized process cycle  
- Cloud-based dashboards (AWS)

### 5. Waste Utilization
- Remaining slurry is fed to a large secondary tank for extended methane generation.

## 🧪 Optimized 6-Day Production Cycle

### Retention Time Comparison

| Stage | Optimized Retention Time | Natural Retention Time |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Hydrolysis & Fermentation | 12–14 hours | 2–45 days |
| Mesophilic Acetogenesis | 2.5 days | 17–25 days |
| Thermophilic Methanogenesis | 3 days | 27–42 days |

## 🔬 Process Implementation Details

### Start Time
- Cycle begins daily at **17:00** with substrate reset and layering.

### Agitation
- Every **6–8 hours**, agitator runs for **5 minutes**.

---

### Stage 1 — Hydrolysis & Fermentation  
- **Time:** 17:15 (Day 1) → 07:00 (Day 2)  
- **Temperature:** 25°C  
- **Initial pH:** 4.25  

### Stage 2 — Mesophilic Acetogenesis  
- **Time:** 07:00 (Day 2) → 17:00 (Day 3)  
- **Temperature:** 24.5°C (night), 46°C (day)  
- **pH:** 7.6  

### Stage 3 — Thermophilic Methanogenesis  
- **Time:** 17:00 (Day 3) → 17:00 (Day 6)  
- **Temperature:** 24.5°C → 75°C  
- **pH:** 7.2  
- **Gas outlet remains open**  

### Pressure Release
- Excess pressure is released into the air jacket during Stages 2 and 3.
